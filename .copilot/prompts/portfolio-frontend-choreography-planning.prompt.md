# Copilot Prompt Module: Portfolio Frontend — Choreography Planning
> Planning-only module for interaction choreography in the `frontend/` repo.

## Purpose
Produce an accessible, implementable choreography plan for portfolio frontend pages/components without making code changes.

## Triggers (use when…)
Use this module when the request is about **designing/structuring motion** in the portfolio frontend, especially:
- animation “storyboarding” for landing pages, sections, or atomic components
- defining timelines, triggers, state models, event orchestration
- specifying reduced-motion graceful degradation and cancel/escape hatches

## Non-triggers (do not use when…)
- The user is asking to implement code changes (use `portfolio-frontend-domain.prompt.md` or Mechanic as appropriate).
- The request is primarily docs/spec work inside `aix/`.

## Hard Guardrails
- Planning only: do not edit files.
- Progressive enhancement: content must work without JS.
- Accessibility: always include a **graceful reduced-motion** variant (shorten/simplify; don’t “turn everything off” unless requested).
- Include cancel/escape hatches: scroll early, focus/keyboard changes, route/page teardown/re-entry.

## Output (must fit Concierge schema)
Return using Concierge’s required structure:
1) **Classification**
2) **Answer / Deliverable**
3) **Assumptions**
4) **Next actions**

Inside **Answer / Deliverable**, include the plan sections:
- A) Assumptions + constraints (including reduced motion)
- B) Component map (templates/components) + state model
- C) Choreography timeline (step-by-step, timing + easing intent)
- D) Event orchestration (triggers, lifecycle, abort rules, resize)
- E) Implementation plan (files/modules, bindings, tuning surface; described, not pasted code)
- F) Test checklist (a11y, performance, regression)
- G) Iteration options (minimum → enhanced)

## Authority notes (multi-root)
- When planning, prefer frontend’s authoritative constraints and conventions:
  - `frontend/.github/copilot-instructions.md`
  - `frontend/js/choreography/**` architecture (Director/sections/triggers)
  - `frontend/njk/**` atomic component structure
- Do not assume sections/controllers exist; verify via repo search before naming concrete targets.
