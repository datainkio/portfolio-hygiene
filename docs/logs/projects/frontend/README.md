# Frontend Logs

This folder stores Concierge/agent maintenance outputs for the `frontend` project.

Project repo (workspace folder): [frontend](../../../../../frontend)

## Why this lives in the scaffold

These reports are operational artifacts (audits, evaluations, run notes). Keeping them in the scaffold avoids polluting the product repo and aligns with the default constraint to avoid editing project files unless explicitly requested.

## Logs

- [2026-01-15-agent-evaluation.md](2026-01-15-agent-evaluation.md)
- [agent-evaluation.md](agent-evaluation.md)
- [agent-evaluation-pre-refresh.md](agent-evaluation-pre-refresh.md)

## Historical note

These reports were originally authored under `frontend/docs/logs/` and have been migrated into the scaffold.
