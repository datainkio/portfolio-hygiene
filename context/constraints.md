# Constraints

This file records **workspace-level constraints** that should not be violated by humans or AI agents.

If a constraint is project-specific (e.g., only `/frontend`), link to that project’s canonical doc rather than duplicating details here.

## Durable constraints (always)

- **Canonical truth lives in** `/context` and `/specs`.
	- Use `/docs` for onboarding, runbooks, and narrative; avoid treating `/docs` as the source of truth.
- **Scope discipline**: do not introduce new tools/patterns or refactor broadly without explicit request.
- **Clarity and consistency**: prefer explicit solutions that mirror existing workspace conventions.
- **Accessibility is non-negotiable**: semantic structure, keyboard support, and reduced-motion respect by default.
- **Performance is intentional**: avoid unnecessary JS/deps; measure or justify animation cost.
- **Noise control / indexing hygiene**: keep search + watcher excludes aligned with `.gitignore` and avoid indexing build outputs, caches, and vendor directories.
- **Secret handling**: never commit tokens; prefer `.env` / CI secrets for `FIGMA_TOKEN`, `AIRTABLE_*`, etc.

## Decision authority

- Accepted ADRs in `/docs/decisions` are authoritative for architectural/process choices.
- If a request conflicts with an accepted ADR, call it out as a drift risk before proceeding.

## Phase guardrails (time-bound)

These are constraints for the current phase and may be promoted to specs or removed as goals change.

- Avoid global, auto-generated inventories (workspace-wide ToCs) unless explicitly requested.
- Avoid heavy automation for logging/indexing until there’s evidence it saves time.
- Avoid broad “cleanup” refactors inside mounted projects unless explicitly approved.

Source of truth for phase guardrails: `/context/current-goals.md`.

## Mounted project constraints

Mounted repos may have additional hard constraints (e.g., generated files, build order, naming).

- `/frontend`: see `/frontend/.github/copilot-instructions.md` for do-not-edit and build-order constraints.
