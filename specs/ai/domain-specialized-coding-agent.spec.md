# Spec: Domain-Specialized AI Coding Agent (11ty + Nunjucks + JS + GSAP + Sanity)

- **Title:** Domain-Specialized AI Coding Agent — Portfolio Frontend Toolkit
- **Owner(s):** Russell
- **Status:** MVP complete (iterating)
- **Last reviewed:** 2026-04-01
- **Scope:** Multi-root workspace with `aix/` (platform scaffold) + `frontend/` (11ty site)
- **Primary objective:** Reduce iteration friction and errors when building/maintaining a portfolio frontend using 11ty/Nunjucks, Tailwind, GSAP choreography, and CMS-backed content.

- MVP evidence: `/aix/docs/logs/2026-01-16-portfolio-frontend-domain-mvp-evidence.md`

## Problem Statement

General-purpose coding assistance tends to:

- miss project-local constraints (auto-generated CSS tokens, Tailwind v4 workflow, 11ty/Nunjucks conventions)
- hallucinate file locations or sections
- bypass established choreography architecture (Director/sections/triggers)

This spec defines a domain-specialized agent behavior that is _predictable_, _constraint-driven_, and _low-drift_ across a multi-root workspace.

## Authority & Sources of Truth

In this workspace:

- Platform scaffold authority: `/aix/` (routing policy, AIX evaluation, workspace hygiene)
- Frontend authority: `/frontend/` (implementation conventions, build workflows, file-scoped prompts)

Precedence (highest → lowest):

1. File-scoped prompts and repo-specific instructions in `/frontend/` (when editing frontend files)
2. `/aix/context/projects/portfolio-frontend.md` (multi-root boundary + pitfalls)
3. `/aix/context/*` + `/aix/specs/*` (platform constraints + evaluation)

## Non-goals

- Replacing Concierge as the only registered Copilot agent in `/aix/`.
- Broad refactors inside `/frontend/` that aren’t required to satisfy the current request.
- Editing generated outputs (e.g., `/frontend/_site/`) or generated design token files.

## Domain Capabilities (Must-Have)

### 11ty + Nunjucks

- Correctly locate pages/templates/components under `/frontend/njk/`.
- Prefer Nunjucks macros for reusable components.
- Respect existing atomic design structure under `/frontend/njk/_includes/`.

### Tailwind v4 + Design Tokens

- Use the project’s npm scripts for CSS builds; do not call Tailwind directly.
- Respect `/frontend/styles/main.css` import order and layer strategy.
- Never hand-edit Figma-generated token files (they are overwritten).

### GSAP Choreography

- Follow the established architecture (AnimationDirector -> section controllers -> triggers/animations).
- Prefer `AnimationBus` events for cross-section coordination.
- Respect reduced-motion handling.
- Treat runtime gating as a contract: `director:ready` must precede preloader exit, and sequence start must follow `preloader:out`.
- Use choreography config from `/frontend/js/choreography/config/index.js` and `/frontend/js/choreography/config/contracts/events.js` (do not reference legacy runtime config modules).
- For runtime sequencing references, use current paths: `/frontend/js/choreography/AnimationDirector.js`, `/frontend/js/preloader/Preloader.js`, `/frontend/js/preloader/readiness.js`, and `/frontend/js/choreography/sequences/landing/LandingSequence.js`.

### CMS-backed content (Sanity primary)

- Treat Sanity as the canonical CMS source for build-time data in 11ty.
- Treat legacy source-system references as historical migration context only, not active implementation guidance.
- Use `/frontend/eleventy/` patterns for collections/filters/shortcodes.

## Guardrails (Hard Constraints)

The domain-specialized agent must:

- verify file existence before citing paths (avoid hallucinations)
- avoid editing `/frontend/_site/` (generated)
- avoid editing Figma-generated CSS token outputs
- avoid invoking Tailwind CLI directly; use npm scripts
- default to `npm run start:nobundle` for local dev (avoid legacy choreography bundle artifacts) until explicitly told otherwise
- verify section names against the live registry in `/frontend/js/choreography/sections/registry.js` before proposing changes
- when naming active landing sections, use the current registry set: `hero`, `video`, `bio`, `awards`, `organizations`, `work` (unless changed in code)

## Deliverables

### D1 — Domain Spec (this document)

Defines scope, constraints, deliverables, and acceptance criteria.

### D2 — Domain Prompt Module (to be created in MVP)

A dedicated prompt module that Concierge can route to for frontend-domain work.

- Location: `/frontend/.copilot/prompts/domain.prompt.md`
- Add to: `/aix/.copilot/prompts/_module-index.md`
- Concierge routing update: `/aix/.copilot/prompts/concierge.prompt.md` (minimal new triggers)

Routing note:

- The domain module uses **Model A** (internal routing map inside a single module); Concierge remains the only router. See `/aix/docs/decisions/0002-portfolio-frontend-domain-model-a.md`.

Current state (MVP):

- The module contains a compact “signals table” for fast classification and a multi-area walkthrough example.

### D3 — Minimal Context Bundle (to be created in MVP)

A stable, low-churn “what to read first” bundle for frontend tasks.

- Location: `/aix/context/projects/portfolio-frontend.md` (already exists; may be extended)
- Optional curated references: `/frontend/docs/` links to choreography + build workflow

### D4 — Probe Task Bank (to be created in MVP)

A small set of canonical tasks used to evaluate AIX improvements.

- Location suggestion: `/aix/specs/ai/domain-agent-probes.spec.md`

## MVP Acceptance Criteria

An MVP is complete when:

- The prompt module exists and is indexed for routing.
- The module reliably:
  - routes to the correct frontend locations (Nunjucks, choreography, CSS build scripts)
  - respects the guardrails above without being reminded
  - produces correct, minimal changes for at least 3 canonical tasks
- Evaluation evidence is recorded (AIX metrics, brief notes, links to artifacts).

MVP status:

- Complete; see `/aix/docs/logs/2026-01-16-portfolio-frontend-domain-mvp-evidence.md`.

## Evaluation Plan (AIX)

Use the AIX scorecard in `/aix/specs/performance/aix.md`.

Minimum evaluation set (first-response emphasized):

1. Add a small Nunjucks macro component under `/frontend/njk/_includes/`.
2. Update a GSAP section controller without breaking Director initialization.
3. Add/adjust an 11ty collection or filter under `/frontend/eleventy/`.

Record:

- FRA/CR/HF/CUS/TTUO
- which sources were used
- any drift or broken-link findings

## Risks

- Drift between platform docs and frontend docs if we copy content instead of linking.
- Over-scoping the “domain agent” into multiple responsibilities; keep it narrow and constraint-first.

## Open Questions

- Should the domain module live only in `/aix/`, or should we also create a project-local agent in `/frontend/.github/agents/` for direct usage?
- Where should the probe bank live long-term (`/aix/specs/ai/` vs `/aix/data/`)?
