- **Title:** Choreographer Module — GSAP/Tailwind Motion Implementation & Selection
- **Owner(s):** AIX / Motion System Maintainers
- **Status:** draft
- **Last reviewed:** 2026-01-18
- **Scope:** All animated UI and page choreography across the site/app (11ty/NJK templates, components, and views). Applies to micro-interactions (Tailwind-first candidates) and choreographed sequences (GSAP-first candidates).

## Motion Principles
- **Cohesion over novelty:** Motion should feel like a single system: shared timing, easing families, and interaction intent.
- **Transform/opacity first:** Prefer GPU-friendly properties (transform, opacity, filter sparingly). Avoid animating layout properties unless justified.
- **State clarity:** Animations must preserve clear UI state at rest (no ambiguous mid-states as defaults).
- **Reduce motion is first-class:** Every pattern must define a motion-reduced variant.
- **Rapid iteration:** Optimize the developer loop—easy to tweak timings and sequencing without hunting through templates.
- **Least power that works:** Prefer Tailwind when it fully satisfies requirements; prefer GSAP when choreography, measurement, or scroll linkage is required.

## Primitives & Utilities
### Shared Motion Tokens (source of truth)
- **Durations:** fast / base / slow (project-defined ms)
- **Eases:** standard / enter / exit / emphasis (project-defined curves)
- **Staggers:** tight / base / loose (project-defined offsets)

### Tailwind Utilities (when Tailwind is selected)
- Custom utilities should map to motion tokens:
  - duration-* classes map to duration tokens
  - ease-* classes map to easing tokens
  - motion-safe / motion-reduce variants required for all animated utilities
- Prefer component-scoped class bundles (e.g., via @apply or named utility groups) to reduce template noise.

### GSAP Primitives (when GSAP is selected)
- **Scene modules:** One scene per file exporting:
  - init(root, opts) -> returns controller with kill() / refresh() as needed
  - kill() must remove ScrollTriggers/tweens/listeners
- **Timelines:** Label-first timelines with consistent naming; avoid anonymous, unlabelled long chains.
- **Hooks:** Use stable DOM hooks (data-attributes) over brittle selectors:
  - data-anim="<scene>" on root
  - data-anim-item for children
  - optional data-anim-trigger overrides

## Patterns by Component/View
### Tailwind-first Patterns (micro-interactions)
Use Tailwind if ALL are true:
1) Discrete transition between two states (open/closed, selected/unselected, hover/focus)
2) No scroll coupling (no scrub/pin/parallax)
3) No layout measurement needed (no animating to/from auto height unless handled without measurement)
4) No choreography beyond trivial delay
5) Limited element count (<= ~6 animated elements)

Examples:
- Button/links hover and focus affordances
- Simple dropdown open/close using opacity/scale and state classes
- Selected state transitions for tabs/pills

### GSAP-first Patterns (choreography)
Use GSAP if ANY are true:
1) Timeline choreography (multi-step, overlaps, labels, staggers)
2) Scroll-linked behavior (enter/leave/scrub/pin)
3) Dynamic measurement required (height auto, FLIP-like, measured endpoints)
4) Reversible sequences with precise state fidelity (play/reverse)
5) Larger element counts or lists/grids where batching matters
6) Needs robust init/teardown due to navigation/partial re-render

Examples:
- Hero intro sequences with staged entrances
- Section reveals with stagger + scroll gating
- ScrollTrigger storytelling (pin/scrub)
- Modal/overlay sequences with coordinated background + content motion

### Selection & Evaluation (module behavior)
The Choreographer module MUST evaluate both Tailwind and GSAP against:
- **Estimated runtime performance** (JS overhead, observers, property choices)
- **Tool capabilities & fit** (timeline/scroll/measurement needs)
- **Adherence to existing motion system & conventions** (tokens, hooks, file structure)
- **DX / extensibility / maintainability** (rapid iteration, readability, reuse)

Guiding assumptions:
- GSAP generally provides better DX than Tailwind for complex motion.
- Code readability is a priority.
- Design for rapid iteration.

### Deterministic Decision Rubric (scoring)
Start score: GSAP = +2 (DX bias), Tailwind = 0

Add points:
- Tailwind +2 if the request is a single 2-state transition with no scroll and no measurement
- Tailwind +1 if the interaction is CSS-native (hover/focus) or purely state-class driven
- Tailwind +1 if <= ~6 targets and no sequencing

- GSAP +2 if choreography/timeline required (stagger, overlaps, labels)
- GSAP +2 if scroll-linked behavior required
- GSAP +2 if measurement required (auto height, FLIP, measured endpoints)
- GSAP +1 if reversible sequences required
- GSAP +1 if > ~6 targets or list/grid entrances
- GSAP +1 if scene must be reusable across multiple pages/components

Decision:
- Choose higher score
- Tie-breaker: choose GSAP

Required output from the module:
- Recommendation (GSAP or Tailwind)
- Rationale summary (why it won)
- Implementation plan aligned to conventions
- Reduced-motion behavior
- Performance notes and measurement guidance

## Performance & Budget
- **Frame budget:** target 60fps; avoid long main-thread work during scroll.
- **Property budget:** prefer transform/opacity; avoid animating layout (top/left/width/height) unless necessary.
- **Scroll budget:** minimize ScrollTrigger instances; batch where possible; avoid continuous per-frame work beyond transforms.
- **Conditional loading:** GSAP scenes should lazy-init by presence of hooks (data-anim) and avoid global eager setup.
- **Measurement guidance:**
  - GSAP: do layout reads once per init (or per refresh) and cache values
  - Tailwind: prefer pure CSS transitions; avoid JS-driven class thrash
- **How to measure:**
  - Use browser Performance panel and FPS meter
  - Record scroll interactions; verify minimal long tasks
  - Add a dev flag to enable GSAP markers and timing logs (project runbook)

## Accessibility
- **prefers-reduced-motion:**
  - Tailwind: use motion-safe/motion-reduce variants; reduced-motion defaults to minimal fade or no motion
  - GSAP: respect reduced motion by shortening timelines, removing movement, and avoiding scroll-scrub; provide instant state or fades
- **Keyboard/focus:**
  - No focus loss during transitions
  - Modals/overlays must maintain focus trap and restore focus on close (if applicable)
- **Fallbacks:**
  - When JS fails, UI must remain usable; Tailwind state classes should not depend on JS for baseline visibility

## Testing & Validation
- **Functional verification:**
  - Verify start/end states match expected UI states
  - Verify init/kill does not duplicate triggers or leak listeners
- **Visual validation:**
  - Record before/after clips for key scenes
  - Optional visual regression snapshots at rest states
- **Performance validation:**
  - Scroll interactions: check for long tasks and dropped frames
  - Count active ScrollTriggers and ensure teardown works
- **Reduced-motion validation:**
  - Test with OS reduced motion enabled; confirm safe behavior

## Decisions
- **Default bias to GSAP** for iterative choreography and reusable scene patterns due to better DX and maintainability.
- **Tailwind preferred** for simple 2-state micro-interactions to reduce JS overhead and complexity.
- **Single token system** required so Tailwind and GSAP outputs feel cohesive.

## Open Questions
- Where are motion tokens defined (Tailwind config vs motion/tokens.js) and what is the canonical source?
- Standard file structure for GSAP scenes and registration (exact paths)?
- What is the project’s preferred reduced-motion behavior for scroll-linked scenes (disable scrub vs replace with discrete enter)?
- Do we need an ADR for the decision rubric and tie-break rule?
