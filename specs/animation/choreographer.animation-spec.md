- **Title:** Choreographer Module — GSAP/Tailwind Motion Implementation & Selection
- **Owner(s):** AIX / Motion System Maintainers
- **Status:** draft
- **Last reviewed:** 2026-01-18
- **Scope:** All animated UI and page choreography across the site/app (11ty/NJK templates, components, and views). Applies to micro-interactions (Tailwind-first candidates) and choreographed sequences (GSAP-first candidates).
- **Links:** context {{/context/motion.md}}, ADRs {{/docs/decisions/motion-*.md}}, runbooks {{/docs/runbooks/motion-debug.md}}

## Work plan (2026-01-22)
- Define Concierge module contract (inputs, triggers, outputs, acceptance criteria) so routing can target it.
- Convert the rubric into an explicit scoring/decision procedure the module must emit in outputs.
- Add a response template (recommendation, rationale, plan, reduced motion, performance, file paths).
- Capture file-path conventions and hook naming for scene registration so answers stay deterministic.
- Resolve open questions: canonical GSAP scene layout and whether to elevate the rubric to an ADR.

## Motion Principles
- **Cohesion over novelty:** Motion should feel like a single system: shared timing, easing families, and interaction intent.
- **Transform/opacity first:** Prefer GPU-friendly properties (transform, opacity, filter sparingly). Avoid animating layout properties unless justified.
- **State clarity:** Animations must preserve clear UI state at rest (no ambiguous mid-states as defaults).
- **Reduce motion is first-class:** Every pattern must define a motion-reduced variant.
- **Rapid iteration:** Optimize the developer loop—easy to tweak timings and sequencing without hunting through templates.
- **Least power that works:** Prefer Tailwind when it fully satisfies requirements; prefer GSAP when choreography, measurement, or scroll linkage is required.

## Primitives & Utilities
### Canonical Sources
- Motion tokens: [specs/animation/motion.tokens.js](specs/animation/motion.tokens.js) (single source of truth for durations, eases, distances, staggers; used by GSAP + Tailwind)
- Tailwind mapping: [specs/animation/tailwind.motion.config.cjs](specs/animation/tailwind.motion.config.cjs) (maps tokens into duration/ease utilities; keep import order consistent with main Tailwind setup)
- Accessibility policy: [specs/animation/motion-accessibility-policy.md](specs/animation/motion-accessibility-policy.md) (reduced-motion rules and strategies)

### Shared Motion Tokens (source of truth)
- **Durations:** fast / base / slow (project-defined ms)
- **Eases:** standard / enter / exit / emphasis (project-defined curves)
- **Staggers:** tight / base / loose (project-defined offsets)

Implementation guidance:
- GSAP: import tokens from `motion.tokens.js`; do not hard-code timings/eases.
- Tailwind: rely on the utilities emitted by `tailwind.motion.config.cjs`; avoid ad-hoc durations/eases in templates.

### Tailwind Utilities (when Tailwind is selected)
- Custom utilities should map to motion tokens:
  - duration-* classes map to duration tokens
  - ease-* classes map to easing tokens
  - motion-safe / motion-reduce variants required for all animated utilities
- Prefer component-scoped class bundles (e.g., via @apply or named utility groups) to reduce template noise.

### GSAP Primitives (when GSAP is selected)
- **Scene modules:** One scene per file exporting:
  - init(root, opts) -> returns controller with kill() / refresh() as needed
  - kill() must remove ScrollTriggers/tweens/listeners
- **Timelines:** Label-first timelines with consistent naming; avoid anonymous, unlabelled long chains.
- **Hooks:** Use stable DOM hooks (data-attributes) over brittle selectors:
  - data-anim="<scene>" on root
  - data-anim-item for children
  - optional data-anim-trigger overrides
- **File structure & registration:**
  - Place GSAP scenes under `frontend/js/choreography/sections/<Scene>/<Scene>.js` (or `sequences/` for multi-section flows) and export init/kill.
  - Register scenes via the Director/Stage wiring (e.g., `Director.js`) so lifecycle and bus events remain centralized.
  - Keep shared helpers (e.g., reduced-motion guards, measurement utilities) under `frontend/js/choreography/managers/` or `utils/` to avoid per-scene duplication.

### How to consume motion tokens (copy/paste)
- **GSAP:**
  ```js
  import { motion, motionTokens } from '../../specs/animation/motion.tokens.js';

  const tl = gsap.timeline({ defaults: { duration: motion.duration('base'), ease: motion.ease('standard') } });
  tl.from(items, { y: motion.distance('md'), stagger: motion.stagger('base'), opacity: 0 });
  ```
- **Tailwind:** use utilities emitted by `tailwind.motion.config.cjs`; keep motion gated:
  ```html
  <button class="
    motion-safe:duration-base motion-safe:ease-enter motion-safe:transition-transform motion-safe:hover:-translate-y-1
    motion-reduce:transition-none motion-reduce:transform-none
  ">Action</button>
  ```

## Patterns by Component/View
### Tailwind-first Patterns (micro-interactions)
Use Tailwind if ALL are true:
1) Discrete transition between two states (open/closed, selected/unselected, hover/focus)
2) No scroll coupling (no scrub/pin/parallax)
3) No layout measurement needed (no animating to/from auto height unless handled without measurement)
4) No choreography beyond trivial delay
5) Limited element count (<= ~6 animated elements)

Examples:
- Button/links hover and focus affordances
- Simple dropdown open/close using opacity/scale and state classes
- Selected state transitions for tabs/pills

### GSAP-first Patterns (choreography)
Use GSAP if ANY are true:
1) Timeline choreography (multi-step, overlaps, labels, staggers)
2) Scroll-linked behavior (enter/leave/scrub/pin)
3) Dynamic measurement required (height auto, FLIP-like, measured endpoints)
4) Reversible sequences with precise state fidelity (play/reverse)
5) Larger element counts or lists/grids where batching matters
6) Needs robust init/teardown due to navigation/partial re-render

Examples:
- Hero intro sequences with staged entrances
- Section reveals with stagger + scroll gating
- ScrollTrigger storytelling (pin/scrub)
- Modal/overlay sequences with coordinated background + content motion

### Selection & Evaluation (module behavior)
The Choreographer module MUST evaluate both Tailwind and GSAP against:
- **Estimated runtime performance** (JS overhead, observers, property choices)
- **Tool capabilities & fit** (timeline/scroll/measurement needs)
- **Adherence to existing motion system & conventions** (tokens, hooks, file structure)
- **DX / extensibility / maintainability** (rapid iteration, readability, reuse)

Guiding assumptions:
- GSAP generally provides better DX than Tailwind for complex motion.
- Code readability is a priority.
- Design for rapid iteration.

### Deterministic Decision Rubric (scoring)
Start score: GSAP = +2 (DX bias), Tailwind = 0

Add points:
- Tailwind +2 if the request is a single 2-state transition with no scroll and no measurement
- Tailwind +1 if the interaction is CSS-native (hover/focus) or purely state-class driven
- Tailwind +1 if <= ~6 targets and no sequencing

- GSAP +2 if choreography/timeline required (stagger, overlaps, labels)
- GSAP +2 if scroll-linked behavior required
- GSAP +2 if measurement required (auto height, FLIP, measured endpoints)
- GSAP +1 if reversible sequences required
- GSAP +1 if > ~6 targets or list/grid entrances
- GSAP +1 if scene must be reusable across multiple pages/components

Decision:
- Choose higher score
- Tie-breaker: choose GSAP

Required output from the module:
- Recommendation (GSAP or Tailwind)
- Rationale summary (why it won)
- Implementation plan aligned to conventions
- Reduced-motion behavior
- Performance notes and measurement guidance

### Concierge module contract (draft)
- **Triggers:** animation/choreography requests, GSAP/Tailwind choice, motion system questions, reduced-motion handling, performance/ScrollTrigger guidance.
- **Inputs:** user request + assets/links; this spec; motion tokens/config files; project routes/templates if provided; reduce-motion policy.
- **Outputs (template):**
  - Decision: GSAP vs Tailwind (include score table: Tailwind score, GSAP score, winner, tie-break applied?).
  - Rationale: 3–5 bullets mapped to rubric factors (timeline, scroll, measurement, element count, DX).
  - Implementation plan: file destinations, hooks/selectors, token usage, reduced-motion adjustments, teardown expectations.
  - Performance: risks + mitigations (property choice, ScrollTrigger count, batching, lazy init).
  - Reduced motion: explicit behavior (disable/simplify) and how to gate it.
  - Validation: what to test (functional, visual, performance, reduced motion).
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - Fills the template above.
  - References token sources and hook conventions.
  - Chooses winner via the rubric; shows scores and tie-break.
  - Names concrete file paths for scenes/templates (or states “path TBD” if unknown).
  - Includes reduced-motion plan and performance callouts.

### Scorecard example (include in responses)
```
Decision: GSAP (tie-breaker not needed)
Scores: Tailwind 3 vs GSAP 7
Tailwind points: +2 single 2-state? no; +1 CSS-native? yes (1); +1 <=6 targets, no sequencing? yes (1) => 2 total (round to 3 if another applies)
GSAP points: +2 timeline? yes (2); +2 scroll? yes (2); +2 measurement? no; +1 reversible? yes (1); +1 >6 targets? no => 5 (plus base +2 bias = 7)
```
Always show which factors contributed so tie-break decisions are auditable.

## Performance & Budget
- **Frame budget:** target 60fps; avoid long main-thread work during scroll.
- **Property budget:** prefer transform/opacity; avoid animating layout (top/left/width/height) unless necessary.
- **Scroll budget:** minimize ScrollTrigger instances; batch where possible; avoid continuous per-frame work beyond transforms.
- **Conditional loading:** GSAP scenes should lazy-init by presence of hooks (data-anim) and avoid global eager setup.
- **Measurement guidance:**
  - GSAP: do layout reads once per init (or per refresh) and cache values
  - Tailwind: prefer pure CSS transitions; avoid JS-driven class thrash
- **How to measure:**
  - Use browser Performance panel and FPS meter
  - Record scroll interactions; verify minimal long tasks
  - Add a dev flag to enable GSAP markers and timing logs (project runbook)

## Accessibility
- Follow the workspace policy in [specs/animation/motion-accessibility-policy.md](specs/animation/motion-accessibility-policy.md): reduced motion defaults to disable/simplify per pattern type and priority.
- Default strategies (if spec does not override):
  - ui: essential → simplify; decorative → disable
  - reveal: essential → simplify; decorative → disable
  - narrative: essential → disable; decorative → disable
- Simplify means: no scroll-linking, no/ tiny stagger, distance 0–xs, prefer fade-only, short durations (instant/fast/base).
- Disable means: skip animation and set final/rest state.
- **prefers-reduced-motion:**
  - Tailwind: use motion-safe/motion-reduce variants; reduced-motion defaults to minimal fade or no motion
  - GSAP: respect reduced motion by shortening timelines, removing movement, and avoiding scroll-scrub; provide instant state or fades
- **Keyboard/focus:**
  - No focus loss during transitions
  - Modals/overlays must maintain focus trap and restore focus on close (if applicable)
- **Fallbacks:**
  - When JS fails, UI must remain usable; Tailwind state classes should not depend on JS for baseline visibility

### Reduced-motion implementation checklist (apply per scene)
- Gate scene init with `isReducedMotion()`; if reduced, apply disable/simplify per strategy before registering ScrollTriggers/tweens.
- Enforce token constraints under reduced motion: durations ∈ {instant, fast, base}; distance ∈ {0, xs}; eases ∈ {standard, enter, exit}; no springy/overshoot.
- No scroll narratives (scrub/pin/parallax) in reduced motion; avoid continuous/looping motion.
- Provide non-motion state cues (text/icon/ARIA) so motion is never required for comprehension.

## Testing & Validation
- **Functional verification:**
  - Verify start/end states match expected UI states
  - Verify init/kill does not duplicate triggers or leak listeners
- **Visual validation:**
  - Record before/after clips for key scenes
  - Optional visual regression snapshots at rest states
- **Performance validation:**
  - Scroll interactions: check for long tasks and dropped frames
  - Count active ScrollTriggers and ensure teardown works
- **Reduced-motion validation:**
  - Test with OS reduced motion enabled; confirm safe behavior

## Decisions
- **Default bias to GSAP** for iterative choreography and reusable scene patterns due to better DX and maintainability.
- **Tailwind preferred** for simple 2-state micro-interactions to reduce JS overhead and complexity.
- **Single token system** required so Tailwind and GSAP outputs feel cohesive.

## Open Questions
- Standard file structure for GSAP scenes and registration (exact paths)?
- Do we need an ADR for the decision rubric and tie-break rule?
- Should the Concierge module response always include a mini scorecard table? (Proposed: yes.)
- Should we add a short prompt module in `.copilot/prompts/` for this? (Proposed: yes, once contract above is frozen.)
