# Feature Specs

This folder defines product features end-to-end so AIX can align implementation with intended outcomes and constraints.

- **Role:** Capture goals/non-goals, user journeys, functional requirements, acceptance criteria, and rollout/analytics expectations for each feature.
- **What lives here:** Feature specs with stories/flows, edge cases, functional rules, acceptance criteria, dependencies/risks, rollout/flag plans, decisions, and open questions.
- **Consumers:** AIX (for requirement grounding), product/design/engineering teams delivering features.
- **Source links:** Tie to UX flows in `/specs/ux/`, data/CMS contracts in `/specs/cms/` or `/specs/data/`, and ADRs in `/docs/decisions/`.
